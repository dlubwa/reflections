When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to collaborate on a project with different users it makes sense to have a remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Its helpful to only pull changes from remote repos manually because you can easily verify those updates prior to the pull rather than having your local repo automatically sync with the remote repo without any kind of policing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a type of clone that is used exclusively on the Github platform and used when you want to work on a repository that you don't have permissions on. A clone is a copy of a remote repository typically stored locally and this comes in handy when you want to work on a project and have the convenience of having the entire copy of it including its commit history locally and offline. A branch allows you to deviate from the main/live and/or production version of a project to make experimental changes or tinker with new features and generally try out completely new ideas without fear of breaking an existing working copy of a project. When you are satisfied and have thoroughly vetted your changes and they are ready for prime time, you may then merge the branch into the main master project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on it offline without needing to be connected to the internet

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Probably rely on sending updated versions of documents back and forth. It would be a lot more time consuming to collaborate on projects as whole
