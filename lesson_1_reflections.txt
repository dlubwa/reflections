How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The diff helped me pin point exactly what line was removed from the old file and what line was added to the new file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would make me a lot more productive

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits mean you only commit when and if you need to. A downside to that is you have to remember to keep up with all your commits and their frequency

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Projects typically are associated with multiple files so it would be easier to track changes to all files in a single commit whereas google docs typically aren't project oriented so it makes sense to track files separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will a show a history of all commits in a repository starting from the most recent while git diff will show you specific changes between two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can very easily revert back to the most recent commit that didn't have the error introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use git to practice version control nuances
